# Arm64_Static_Link_Toolchain_RPI3
Static Linked GCC8.2 Toolchain and RAM console environment for Raspberry Pi 3B arm64


This is a static linked GCC 8.2 toolchain and console environment for Raspberry Pi 3B in arm64 mode. Due to github size limits, most 
sources are referred to by name and version, with only config options present. This image boots using busybox init, and is statically 
linked using the (excellent) musl C library. 

Included software, statically linked, is busybox, gpm, screen, nano, elinks, mpg123, ogg123 and Timidity++.

Enjoy!
